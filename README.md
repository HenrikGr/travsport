## Run the app locally

1. Install Node.js, the latest LTS version - 12.13.0
2. Clone this repo, https://github.com/HenrikGr/travsport.git
3. Run `npm install` to install the app's dependencies
5. Run `npm start` to start the app


Note: My first worker solution, and it was quite interesting and there are 
props and cons with this kind of architecture.
