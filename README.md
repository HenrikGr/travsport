Note: Node.js Worker Threads allow concurrent execution of JavaScript code. If you are familiar with the Unix thread 
model, you know that for every process group there is a parent process and several child processes. A similar model is 
used for Worker Threads in this solutions.

It was great fun to write my first solution based on worker threads. :-)
